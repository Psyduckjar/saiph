Many of these are half-baked ideas, to be investigated as much as implemented.

* Generalize pathfinding to generate arbitrary commands, not just directions.  As a start it should be possible for saiph to path through floating eye by Elberething them away (to prevent oscillations, for a start).

  * Another good idea, tying in to item actions, is a tactical analyzer (to borrow a 523 term) that paths across water by fetching levitation boots.  I think the best way would be to accumulate water tiles in a queue and process them all (with triangle-inequality estimated distances) when a levitation item is determined to be reachable.

  * When Loot is interpreted as "having items just in case", a sensible implementation of bag use starts to suggest itself.

* Can bagging of gold be handled without redoing Loot?

* Don't melee nymphs, E when next to nymphs

* Kiting

* Figure out why saiphs rarely eat elves, fix it

* Try to track nutrition better, so we know when we can eat eyes

* More debug interfaces: display any level

* A TAEB-like item possibilities tracker?

* Understand whatever makes saiphs quit sokoban.  [It's the lack of any "go to sokoban" code]

* Make a branch to experiment with "item actions": Analyzers can say not just "go to a point and do something", but also "get an item and do something".  This simplifies Loot's job quite a bit, as it will only have to deal with items that some analyzer wants to keep in inventory "just in case", like unihorns.

* Situation patch stuff

  * I feel the saiph repo isn't quite the right place for this.

  * canidae wants documentation!

  * Add support for starting in places other than Dlvl 1, like Sokoban or the Castle.

  * Control flags like immortality_on

  * inventory should clear out existing items

  * support item modifiers "equipped" and "identified"; perhaps the latter should be more fine-grained

  * Levels: place monsters at locations, traps, hard_floor, no_monster_gen, doors, shops, knowledge maps.

  * Character: set HP, XL, spells, skills.

* Test and fix footrice barehanded avoidance

* Test and fix "Closed for inventory" processing; don't kick down the doors!

  * Don't visit ad aerarium closets unless we can teleport or dig.

* Handle inventory full conditions without looping.  If rawrmage won't, also handle Overloaded.

* Look into implementing shopping

* Try to avoid backtracking to beatify a single elven leather helm or dagger or whatever

* Since saiph likes teleportation so much, she should kill tengu

* Loot boxes

* Dispose of trolls

* Perhaps hunt for the quest portal (but don't attempt the quest yet)

* Finish Explore refactor

* Quest analyzer: should path to leader if "Home 1" known and xl14, should hoard qarts and Bell

* Teach Fight to track covetous mobs
  int _covetous_timeout; // if 50 turns on one level without seeing a single covetous mob, assume they all went upstairs
  std::map<std::string, int> _covetous_on_level; // last seen location of each boss
  // will have issues with Double Trouble and chameleon master liches, but fine for now
  // if there are known covetors, Fight will path to the > on the level they are on, then go down once in melee range
